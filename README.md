# TraficSignDetection

Traffic Signs Detection
Project
We will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.

Dataset
The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images.
